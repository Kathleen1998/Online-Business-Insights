# Online-Business-Insights

Project Description: A summary of the project, the problem you were trying to solve, and the insights you aimed to uncover.
Analyzed online sales data using SQL to identify key performance indicators and customer purchasing trends. Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the data, providing stakeholders with real-time insights to optimize marketing strategies and inventory management.

Data Source: Where did you get the data? (e.g., Kaggle, a public dataset, etc.)
The source of my dataset comes from Kaggle. E-Commerce Data , it's a public dataset. "The UCI Machine Learning Repository has made this dataset containing actual transactions from 2010 and 2011." Also, ""This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.""
